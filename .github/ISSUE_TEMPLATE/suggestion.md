name: Request Puppet Forces Return
about: As of the latest patch, the 0.12 Beta, I noticed Overlords can no longer request forces from their puppets for any country, at least the ones I checked, and it would inhibit the creativity of the players not to be able to move their Ai Puppet Forces around as they wish, especially in the case of Germany. And no devs or other members have confirmed if this change was in part to the new 1.9.2 patch, or the new Beta 0.12 patch.

**Quick questions**
HOI4 version: 1.9.2
Kaiserreich version: Beta 0.12

**Describe the change you would like:**
Return the ability of overlords to request all forces from puppets in addition to land

**Explain the reasoning behind this change:**
It allows for more creativity of players to better utilize their puppets, preventing Ai from not taking part in conflicts or hindering the Overlord by being somewhere they should not. 

**Additional context or comments:**
I would also like to know if this was an intentional change for the Beta 0.12, an unforseen issue between the Beta 0.12 and the 1.9.2 Patch, or just undetected alteration to game files.
